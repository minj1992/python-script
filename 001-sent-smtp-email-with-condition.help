✅ 1. import smtplib
Think of this as:
📬 A mailman who knows how to talk to email servers (like Gmail, Outlook, etc.) and send emails.

smtplib = Simple Mail Transfer Protocol library.

It lets Python connect to an email server and send messages from your script.

You use it to log in to your email account, create a connection, and send messages.

✅ 2. from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
Think of this as:
📦 A box that can hold multiple parts of your email — like the subject, body, attachments, etc.

MIMEMultipart means "Multi-part MIME message" — this is how real emails are built.

You need this when your email includes HTML, attachments, or text + images, etc.

It’s like a container that helps build a complex email piece by piece.

✅ 3. from email.mime.text import MIMEText
Think of this as:
📝 The paper you write your message on.

MIMEText is used to create the main content of your email (like the message body).

You can tell it whether your message is plain text ('plain') or formatted like a webpage ('html').

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
MIMEText("Hello", "plain")     # Just plain text
MIMEText("<h1>Hello</h1>", "html")  # Fancy HTML text
🧠 Summary:
Code	What it Does	Easy Explanation
import smtplib	Sends email using an email server	The mailman that delivers email
MIMEMultipart()	Builds full email with parts	The box that holds all the parts
MIMEText()	Adds body (plain or HTML) to email	The paper with your mess
